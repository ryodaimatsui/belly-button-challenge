## Project Description
This project aims to develop an interactive dashboard for exploring the 'Belly Button Biodiversity dataset,' revealing the prevalence of certain microbial species in human navels, with some OTUs found in over 70% of individuals, while others remained less common.

The dashboard consists of 5 components:

- The dropdown menu on the top left allows the user to change the values of the chart depending on the ID of the subject.
- The panel right below the dropdown menu displays the subject's information.
- The horizontal bar chart to the right of the dropdown menu and panel, shows the top 10 OTUs, or operational taxanomic units, of the subject.
- The gauge chart on the upper right, represents the belly button washing frequency of the subject, which ranges from 0-9.
- Finally, the bubble chart on the bottom of the page, displays all the samples taken from the subject.

## Tools and Technology

- Visual Studio Code (VSCode) — coding and development
- HTML — structuring the web page
- JavaScript — interactivity
- D3.js and Plotly (both JavaScript libraries) — data manipulation and creating dynamic data visualizations.
